## What we learned
I learned many important fundementals of javascript creating this project.  I used a combination of APIs to fetch data and also display data in UI. The most important things we learned was time management and team work to acheive tasks collectively and collaborate with each other.

## Challenges 
There were a few challenges we ran into devoloping this website. We had a hard time figuring out which APIs to use. Once APIs were finalised we had a bit of trouble fetching information. Once information is fetched we had trouble with diplaying across. Most importantly with google maps API, we had trouble with displaying it. But finally we managed it by following google documentation and generating API.
